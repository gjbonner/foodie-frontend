## This is the frontend to an application I created called "What To Make". I love to cook but often find myself unsure of what I want to actually make for dinner. With What To Make, users can type in ingredients, filter out potential allergies, and the app will fetch from the Yummy API and give the user recommendations on what to make based on the users ingredient input!
